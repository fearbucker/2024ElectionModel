# 2024 Poll Scraper and Election Model
Roughly based off of [this](https://github.com/MattC137/Election-Predictor-Trump-vs-Biden/tree/master) 2020 model project

- Main.R scrapes RCP averages and runs a simple Johnson Distribution simulation n times 
- SimpleEC contains electoral college data
- simple2020EC, state_summary_20, and 2020Scraper contains 2020 data and the collection of 2020 data

As of 9/6/2024, the model projects a 51% chance of Trump victory and a 48% chance of a Harris victory. This is roughly in line with prediction markets at the moment.
